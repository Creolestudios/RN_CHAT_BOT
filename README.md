# WatcherAI 🤖

Welcome to React Native ChatBot App! In this App, we have combined the capabilities of ChatGPT and DALL-E to create a versatile chat bot experience. Users can engage in conversations with the chat bot powered by ChatGPT, and upon receiving certain prompts or requests, the bot utilizes DALL-E to generate relevant images to enrich the conversation.

Additionally, it includes features like speech-to-text and text-to-speech for enhanced user interaction.

# Features 🔥

**ChatGPT Integration:** Utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT model to provide conversational capabilities, allowing users to interact with the chatbot in natural language.

**DALL-E Integration:** Incorporates OpenAI's DALL-E model to generate images based on textual descriptions provided by users during the conversation.

**Speech-to-Text:** Enables users to input text to the chatbot by speaking instead of typing, enhancing accessibility and convenience.

**Text-to-Speech:** Provides the chatbot's responses audibly to users, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

## Technologies Used ⚡

**React Native:** A JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications.

**OpenAI's ChatGPT:** ChatGPT is a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. It uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses based on given prompts or conversation contexts.

**OpenAI's DALL-E:** DALL-E is an image generation model developed by OpenAI. It generates images from textual descriptions, creating novel visual content based on the provided input.

## Getting Started 🚀

First, you will need to install **Node Modules**, which contains the dependencies (libraries) that your project relies on.

To Install **Node Modules**, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

Following the successful installation of **Node Modules**, the next step involves installing **pods** for iOS.

```
cd ios && pod install
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Start your Application ⚡

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

### Running the Android app 🤖

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### Running the iOS app 📱

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! 🎉

You've successfully run your **WatcherAI** App. 🥳
